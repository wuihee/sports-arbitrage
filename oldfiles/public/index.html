      <h2>What is Sports Arbitrage?</h2>
      <p>
        *Sports arbitrage is a strategy that involves placing bets on all possible outcomes of a
        sporting event to guarantee a profit regardless of the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        These opportunities present themselves because different bookmakers offer different odds
        for the same sporting event. And we can take advantage of this discrepancy to make free
        money.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        Let's say there is a tennis match between Player A and Player B.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookmaker 1 offers odds of 2.10 on Player A.</li>
        <li>Bookmaker 2 offers odds of 2.10 on Player B.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By placing a bet of $100 on Player A with Bookmaker 1 and a bet of $100 on Player B with
        Bookmaker 2, you are guaranteed a return of $210 no matter who wins, which gives you a
        profit of $10 on your $200 total bet.
      </p>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        However, it is not easy to arb. Betting odds move very quickly making it hard to place
        bets consistently. In addition, bookmakers hate arbing and will quickly ban you when
        they realize what you are doing.
      </p>
      <h2>How Does This Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Real-time data on sporting odds can be retrieved from the
        <a href="https://the-odds-api.com">Odds API</a>. For each sporting event, we search for
        arbitrage opportunities by finding the <em>maximum odds</em> offered by all available
        bookmakers. We can calculate the <em>arbitrage percentage</em> by taking the sum of the
        reciprocal of the odds and if this percentage is less than 1, we have an arbitrage.
      </p>

        In the text box below, enter your <em>stake</em>, or amount of money you want to bet.
        I will help you to calculate how much money you could possibly make from current sporting
        events.
